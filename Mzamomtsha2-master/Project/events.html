          <p>If you love towering trees, magical mountain views and wonderful birdlife, then get yourself to Grootvadersbos, perhaps Cape Nature's most beautiful forest reserve, in the foothills of the Langeberg Mountains. Hiking and birding are the main attractions here, along with the 60-metre-high redwoods that are just a short walk from the campsite.</p>

            <p>Beautiful, green lawns flow into the Breede River at Eureka Farm's River Goose Campsite. Spend your days canoeing or tubing in the warm river water, or pop down the road to one of the many wine farms for a tasting (Van Loveren Family Wines does an excellent cheese and wine pairing).</p>

            <p>Sunset on the Langeberg is one of the most beautiful sights in South Africa, and Oewerzicht is a wonderful place to enjoy it. Apart from the stunning scenery, there's also fishing and canoeing in the Riviersonderend River which gurgles right past the campground, plus hiking and mountain biking through the surrounding farmland.</p>
