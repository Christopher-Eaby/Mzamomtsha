            Mzamomtsha School is in the remote township of Driftsands, located between Mfuleni and Khayelitsha. We started off as a primary school, only attending to grades ranging from 1-7, but due to the sudden growth of population we now accomodate all grades from 1 through to matric.
          </p>
           
          <p>
            Currently, the school has a shortage of classrooms and chairs. This follows an early 2018 instruction from the district office for the school to accommodate children who could not fit into overcrowded Mfuleni schools. The Department of Education promised the school mobile classes to help handle the increased learner population, but these have still had not been delivered.
          </p> 
           
          <p>
            Parents organised a protest to highlight the school's needs, but nothing has changed. Frustrations are growing, and parents are even contemplating closing down the school permanently as they feel the
            learning conditions their children are enduring are unacceptable.
          </p>
           
          <p>
            The school is run under the leadership of Principal Simphiwe Kuze and 9 members of staff, with a total of 530 students
          </p>
